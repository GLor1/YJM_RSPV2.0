                        <p><span style="font-size:24px">February 8, 2018</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>As far back as 2011, a circuit court judge wrote a letter to the governor, and reflected
                                that the conditions were so bad that he would “think long and hard before sending
                                another youth” to that place. We need more judges to take a stand and refuse to send
                                young people into that environment.
                                <br>
                            

                                And why wait to close it? Walker should take immediate steps to shutter these
                                institutions. There is no reason to keep young people in a facility that uses solitary
                                confinement, restraints and pepper spray and simply warehouses young people in cells for
                                up to 23 hours a day instead of providing real rehabilitation. Wisconsin’s youth prisons
                                have an atrocious recidivism rate — more than 60% of first-time offenders end up
                                reoffending within three years of release — a direct result of taking this wrong
                                approach to rehabilitation.
                                <br>

                                That’s why any delay in closing these failed facilities and investing in community
                                alternatives that are proven to work better is unacceptable. An extra year or two might
                                not seem like a big deal for those used to the glacial pace of statehouse politics, but
                                for youth, the consequences of waiting are potentially life-changing. A young person who
                                spends an extra year in Lincoln Hills is put that much further behind on his or her path
                                to recovery – and is in even more danger of falling into the path of recidivism and
                                adult prison. Young people who make a mistake could wind up in an oversized, outdated
                                facility that further traumatizes them instead of at an effective community-based
                                treatment program that can help them get back on track.
                                <br>

                                The fact that in Wisconsin young people of color — largely from Milwaukee — are being
                                locked up at a rate more than 16 times the national average means that the onus is on us
                                to act fast if we are to stand true to our values and begin to chip away at the vast
                                racial disparities in our criminal justice system.
                                <br>

                                The reasons to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake — and close them quickly — are clear.
                                But we also must work carefully to create a more effective youth justice system for the
                                future and not repeat past mistakes.
                                <br>

                                Governor Walker’s proposal, which entails closing the large prisons and replacing them
                                with several smaller facilities, is on the right track. But the members of the community
                                who are most impacted by the youth justice system — the advocates, families and youth
                                themselves who have been fighting for a better system for years — need a seat at the
                                table and have a voice in the process of transforming youth justice in Wisconsin.
                                <br>

                                There is a path forward. Instead of youth prisons, we envision a system that strives to
                                keep young people at home, with their families and support systems that can actually
                                help them heal. Youth should only be removed from home as a last resort. In rare
                                circumstances where we need secure placements, these facilities should be small — no
                                more than 15 beds — and therapeutic in nature.
                                <br>

                                The public supports this approach. In fact, 75% of Wisconsinites support community-based
                                alternatives that emphasize a young person’s wellbeing over large institutions and
                                prisons. Even more support rehabilitation plans that involve a youth’s family in
                                treatment, an acknowledgment of the significant role that community support can play in
                                recovery.
                                <br>

                                We have a unique opportunity to move forward and adopt an approach to reforming
                                Wisconsin’s youth justice system that values the input of impacted communities and gets
                                us better outcomes. This is the hallmark of strong, inclusive, people-centered
                                leadership that the citizens of Wisconsin expect. Let’s do this now.
                                <br>
